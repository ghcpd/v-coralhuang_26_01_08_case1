You are a senior Python engineer. You are working in a local Python project with:
- mini_humanize.naturalsize (may be refactored/optimized)
- an unimplemented mini_humanize.parse_size
- a CLI skeleton (python -m mini_humanize)

Deliver a production-ready library. The deliverables must include:

1) README.md  
   - Describe the Python APIs (naturalsize / parse_size) with purpose and parameters  
   - Describe CLI usage with examples  
   - Document how ambiguous inputs are interpreted, error-handling policies, and rounding rules  
   - Provide exactly one command that runs the full test suite

2) tests/ directory (pytest)  
   - You must design the test structure and test cases yourself  
   - Tests must cover the key behavioral dimensions listed below  

3) One-click test script: run_tests  
   - The file name must be exactly `run_tests` (no extension)  
   - You must create this script  
   - The script must be runnable repeatedly in any clean environment  
   - If required dependencies are missing, the script must install them before running tests  
   - The screquirements:

parse_size must handle real-world size strings. Consider:
- Multiple unit systems and conventions
- Various number formats (scientific notation, separators, etc.)
- Ambiguous inputs and edge cases
- Large numbers

You decide the API design (parameters, behavior, error handling). Document all design decisions in README.

naturalsize must preserve backward compatibility (default outputs must not change).

--------------------------------
Testing requirements:

Design a comprehensive test suite. At minimum, you must cover:
- Normal paths with various units and formats
- Edge cases and error conditions
- Round-trip consistency (parse_size ↔ naturalsize)
- CLI functionality (via subprocess)
- Backward compatibility verification

The concrete test cases, coverage goals, and testing strategy are your responsibility.

--------------------------------
Constraints:

- No third-party dependencies beyond pytest / pytest-cov
- Type annotations must be preserved
- Must handle inputs up to at least 2^70 bytes without precision loss
- Parse complexity must be O(n) where n is input string length

parse_size should handle real-world size strings with various unit conventions, number formats, and edge cases.

You decide: API parameters, error handling, ambiguity resolution, supported formats. Document your design clearly.

naturalsize must not break existing behavior on default settings.

--------------------------------
Testing expectations:

Design comprehensive tests covering normal cases, errors, round-trip consistency, CLI, and backward compatibility.

Quality matters: organization, coverage, maintainability.

--------------------------------
Constraints:

- Only pytest/pytest-cov dependencies
- Keep type annotations
- Support numbers >= 2^70 bytes  
- O(n) parse complexity
